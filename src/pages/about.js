    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <p>
      When organizers in DSM first convened, there was an immediate goal to create a Des Moines Black Lives Matter chapter. After beginning actions and thinking further about the possibility of becoming a chapter, it was decided to not continue with that route and instead become an entity of our own. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Des Moines Black Liberation Movement is a collective of young organizers in Des Moines,made up of various gender identities, cultural backgrounds, and political beliefs - but brought together around the unifying understanding that Black people matter and have been systematically oppressed since the inception of this nation. Des Moines BLM organizes to elevate awareness around the inner workings of systematic oppression in order to root them out. Des Moines BLM came together following the horrific murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department, and are adamantly focused on abolishing police, starting with the Des Moines Police Department. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Des Moines BLM was founded on June 2nd, 2020 and established their first community protest on June 3rd, 2020.
    </p>

    <p>
      We operate under two separate branches, the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement Foundation, a 501(c)(3), and the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement Collective, a 501(c)(4). 
    </p>

    <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      Des Moines BLM is committed to decolonization on the path to Black Liberation and therefore, acknowledges the genocide of Indigenous Peoples in the “United” States.
    </p>

    <p>
      We understand that Black Lives Matter goes beyond saying the names of those murdered by systemic white supremacists violence. Des Moines BLM is here to lend its work to the legacy that is human rights for Black people in the so called USA, particularly in the state of Iowa. DSM BLM is organizing in the capital city of Des Moines. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that Black Lives Matter. This ideology is inclusive of all Black lives; trans Black lives, Black differently-abled folks, Black mothers, Black folks living in poverty, Black sex workers, Afro-Latinx folks, Black Queer folks, Afro-Indigineous folks, and all other survivors of the African Diaspora.
    </p>

    <p>
      We understand that the history of policing in America is directly intertwined with white supremacy. Policing in the USA originated even before police forces were established. Overseers were some of the first agents to enforce free Black labor.  (TIMELINE/YEAR applicable) Policing roots also included slave patrols to monitor the movement of Black people and to protect property. Municipal vigilantes who protected the property of northern capitalists.
    </p>

    <p>
      We find these practices still evident in policing today. Police officers are the agents used to snatch and transport Black people into jails and prisons, continuing the legacy of slavery in this country by forcing them into slave labor in the guise of the prison industrial complex. We understand policing as it stands in this country to be an unnecessary evil that entraps Black folks specifically in a system of modern day slavery. In addition, police enforce segregation and redlining as well as medical apartheid, educational racism through the school to prison pipeline, environmental racism, and all other forms of racist violence.
    </p>

    <p>
      We see alternatives to policing in this country already happening. We believe in following the lead of other cities across the country in their efforts to defund their local police departments. Our solutions will also come from the Black communities of the Greater Des Moines area most impacted by police terrorism.
    </p>

    <p>
      We understand this fight to abolish the Des Moines Police Department did not start and may not end with us. We honor the legacy our ancestors initiated for us centuries ago and we use this as the base of our power. We are committed to dedicating our energy to dismantle institutionalized power systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Rituals</h2>
    <h3>5 fingers of solidarity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We will not kneel with, pray with or march with cops. These acts sanitize the history of racist violence.</li>
      <li>We will not, unprovoked, lash out against people or property. These acts endanger our friends, family and the movement.</li>
      <li>Friends don't let friends get arrested. If we see somebody getting unjustly arrested we will do all we can to dearest them. Acts of self-defense are moments of radical love and liberation.</li>
      <li>In moments of danger we will not run, scream or panic. Doing so creates the environment for chaos and can lead to the most vulnerable among us being harmed.</li>
      <li>We will pay attention to each other and relay messages. Some of which may be to call a retreat, call for a medic or call for the people’s attention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Principles</h2>
    <h3>Marching and Kneeling with Cops</h3>
    <p>
      We call to defund and abolish the police. We do not support the involvement of police in our movement in <strong>any form or capacity. We DO NOT ACT in solidarity with police officers.</strong> We <strong>do not seek</strong> to reform police officers. We seek to <strong>leave every single police officer without a job</strong>, first in Des Moines, then in Polk County, then in Iowa, then across the United States of America.
    </p>

    <h3>Nonviolence, a Tactic not a Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      DSM BLM believes in evaluating our resources and applying pressure only when necessary. We see self-defense as a tactic and will use force only if we deem applicable. We believe that using force against our oppressors is morally right, an act of community solidarity, and radical love.
    </p>

    <h3>Beyond Policing</h3>
    <p>
      The goal to defund law enforcement agencies across the nation is rooted in being deeply invested community members who have a keen awareness of the injustices committed by DMPD and police worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the over $70,000,000 that DMPD receives in tax payers funds, DSM BLM know that these funds will be better used if applied directly to our communities instead of to entities that terrorize our neighborhoods and police our people. Our plan as DSM BLM is to uplift our communities and to create programming that does so.
    </p>

    <h2>What we are founded on</h2>
    <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Des Moines Black Liberation Movement works to recognize systemic oppression, eradicate racist structures, and create institutions and processes that support Black livelihood and end white supremacy in the state of Iowa. We want to defund and abolish the police in order to reallocate funding to public services and restore power to the people. We want justice for every BIPOC that has been a victim of white supremacy, state-sanctioned police violence or other injustice. We want racial equity and to hold our elected officials accountable.
    </p>

    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>

Programs produced and piloted by DSM BLM are geared towards improving upon the living experiences of Black folks in our community. We stand in solidarity with groups working to bring about racial justice across the state of Iowa.
